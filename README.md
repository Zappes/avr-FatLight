The FatLight
======================================

What Is this?
-------------
Short: It's a controller board for RGB LED strips that has a bluetooth and some GPIO pins.

Long: I recently ordered everything needed for the creation of PCBs, i.e. a UV exposure unit,
an etching apparatus, chemicals, boards, the works. As a first project, I wanted to do something
that I could use, that I understood from the electronics perspective and that could easily be
done on a one-sided PCB without solder mask. A controller for RGB strips seemed to be a good idea, so here we go. :)

**WARNING IF YOU WANT TO BUILD THIS**
Make sure that the pinout of your Bluetooth module matches the pinout on the board. I have three different HC-05 modules in my parts bin, and every type has a different pinout ... This sucks enormously, and if I didn't have those modules lying around, I'd use a pure HC-05 module instead of the breakouts i have now.
